# React and GraphQL

This repository has a few simple React apps connected to the GraphQL server we
created in the last GraphQL Tampa Bay meetup.

This code was originally part of the [React and GraphQL] workshop.

## Getting started

1. Install the latest version of [Node JS]
2. Follow the steps in the [previous repository] to get the server up and running
3. Run `npm start` to build, run, and open the React app in your browser

## About this app

This app demonstrates multiple ways to build a simple React app with GraphQL.

Ths app leverages [Create React App] for a zero-config React app.

A production app would typically pick only one GraphQL client and use that
across the entirety of the codebase, but we intentionally wanted to show
multiple tools so you can compare and contrast their usage.
